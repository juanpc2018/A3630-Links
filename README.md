The price and avability of a real Motorola / Freescale 68060 Rev6 CPU</br>
is getting ridiculous, $400usd. from China or Russia for a 50MHz CPU. </p>

Also 060 CPUs are Not compatible with most games designed for Amiga 500, </br>
There were too many changes "Revisions" between Original 68k CPU and 060 Rev6. </br>
030 CPU is closer, more compatible to the Original 68k CPU. </br>
example: </br>

There was also LC060 and EC060, without FPU and MMU </br>
adding support for 68881/68882 in the PCB allow those CPUs perform the same as Non LC / EC. </br>
IF software requires those instructions, but if does Not, adding an FPU coprocessor is wasting money, </br>
Have Not seen a list of Software that benefits from an FPU </br>
Large CPU FastRAM is much better vs. FPU with No RAM. </br>

Having real TCXO is better. </br>
people can swap to other frequencies more easy.. </br>
just swapping the TCXO. </p>

Dual 14-pin dil TCXO for 060 and 68882, maybe? Jumper for Single / same? </p>

FPGA generated clocks are good, but Not as accurate or stable as a real TCXO. </p>
