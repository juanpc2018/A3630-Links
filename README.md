# A3630-Links

The price and avability of a real Motorola / Freescale 68060 Rev.6 </br>
is getting ridiculous, $400usd. from China or Russia for a 50MHz CPU. </p>

There was also LC060 and EC060, without FPU and MMU </br>
adding support for 68882 in the PCB would allow those CPUs perform the same as Non LC / EC. </br>
like 030 boards. </br>

Also having real TCXO is better. </br>
people can swap to other frequencies more easy.. </br>
just swuapping the TCXO. </p>

Dual 14-pin dil TCXO for 060 and 68882, maybe? Jumper for Single / same? </p>

FPGA generated clocks are good, but Not as accurate or stable as a real TCXO. </p>
